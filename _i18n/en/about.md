Welcome to my little corner 💫

I started this blog simply because I wanted to write about the lessons and memorable events in my life. I also want to improve my English writing skills 😁 So, please don't expect any glamorous stories or cinematic phrases. I aim for simplicity and modesty with an inward-looking attitude. I hope you'll find something interesting in my stories 💛
