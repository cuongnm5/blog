What is the most challenging thing you have ever done? For me, it was the experience of auditioning for VNG MC Club a year ago.

I never thought I would become an MC. In fact, back when I was in school, I lacked the confidence to speak up because I was afraid of people's judgment. But somehow, it felt like there was an invisible force challenging my courage: to dare to audition for the club.

Until now, I am still grateful for overcoming that challenge. Thanks to that, even though I am not a regular member of the club (because I often skip classes ðŸ˜„), the values that the club has brought me are truly worth it. Besides getting to "meet famous people whom I had only seen on TV" and learning specialized knowledge about voice, acting, and situations, I have also learned many unique experiences and perspectives through the stories shared by everyone. For example, treating people as potatoes if you feel nervous in front of a crowd, or instead of waiting anxiously without knowing when your name will be called, gather up all your courage to be the first to step forward and break free from the prolonged worry.
